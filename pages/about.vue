            Iâ€™m Destinee Founder and Owner of Roses In Rhapsody. You might be
            asking, why do I do this? Why do I love making dreams of romance a
            reality? Why am I willing to invest so much care into your event,
            and do so much work to make it a touching moment you and your loved
            ones wont forget?
            <br /><br />
            It's because Dreams of romance have always stuck in my head ever
            since I read my first Lisa Kleypas book, &apos;Again The Magic&apos;
            when I was fourteen. I imagined my handsome prince would come and
            sweep me off my feet. When I turned 19, I got married to that
            prince. Then after a couple of years, our princess was born,
            completing our family.
            <br /><br />
            I know it's those memorable moments have value that lasts a
            lifetime. I want to help bring that to other people.
