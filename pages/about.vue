          Iâ€™m Destinee Founder and Owner of Roses In Rhapsody. You might be
          asking, why do I do this? Why do I love making dreams of romance a
          reality? Why am I willing to invest so much care into your event, and
          do so much work to make it a touching moment you and your loved ones
          wont forget?
          <br /><br />
          It's because Dreams of romance have always stuck in my head ever since
          I read my first Lisa Kleypas book, &apos;Again The Magic&apos; when I
          was fourteen. I imagined my handsome prince would come and sweep me
          off my feet. When I turned 19, I got married to that prince. Then
          after a couple of years, our princess was born, completing our family.
          <br /><br />
          I know it's those memorable moments have value that lasts a lifetime.
          I want to help bring that to other people.
